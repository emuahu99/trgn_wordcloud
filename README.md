#About the app
*This is a simple program that is built on the basis of homo_sapiens genes. The first part it to transform the Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf file into a dictionary so that Ensembl genes correspond to each HUGO gene names. The second part is to replace the Ensembl gene names in a second dataset,expres.anal.csv, to HUGO gene names.
